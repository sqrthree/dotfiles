# Dotfiles

Tracking my own dotfiles. Those are opinionated and contains only my own personal settings.

### Install vim only:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqrthree/dotfiles/master/vim/vimrc -o ~/.vimrc
```

or just with basic configs:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sqrthree/dotfiles/master/vim/vimrc-basic -o ~/.vimrc
```
